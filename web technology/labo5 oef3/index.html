                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing 
                and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been 
                the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
                the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gall
                ey of type and scrambled it to make a type spec
                imen book. It has survived not only five centur
                ies, but also the leap into electronic typesett
                ing, remaining essentially unchanged. It was pop
                ularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
                 sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more 
                 recently with desktop publishing software like Al
                 dus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be 
                distracted by the readable content of a page when 
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ip
                sum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribut
                i still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved 
                over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on 
                purpose (injected humour and the like).
